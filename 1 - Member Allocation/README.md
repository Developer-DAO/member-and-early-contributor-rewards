# Member Allocation (Airdrop)

The $CODE issuance will reward all DAO members with governance tokens. A DAO member is defined as a `Devs for Revolution` NFT holder before block #13612670. Each address that holds at least 1 NFT receives `X` tokens. Membership into the DAO will require these same `X` tokens. We also want to provide additional tokens through the airdrop to reward more active members.

Members that participated in our snapshot voting or claimed a meeting POAP **before Season 0** will receive `Y` additional tokens.

The equation for the member allocation section for each member will then be:

> X Tokens (Holding NFT) + Y Tokens (If Voted or POAP)

## Snapshot Voting & POAP Claiming

Due to timezones, not everyone was able to attend meetings and claim POAPs. However, our snapshot votes lasted for many days allowing the chance for everyone to vote.

There are **906 unique addresses** eligible for these additional tokens.
