# Member Allocation & Early Contributors

Part of the goal in the Developer DAO token launch is to reward DAO members & early contributors with $CODE. There will be two separate `allocations` for members - two pieces of the pie.

1. A `member allocation` that will be claimed through the airdrop.
2. An `early contributors allocation` to members who have contributed to the DAO from the beginning of the DAO to the end of Season 0.

## 1 - Member Allocation (Airdrop)

The $CODE issuance will reward all DAO members with governance tokens. A DAO member is defined as a `Devs for Revolution` NFT holder before block #13612670. Each address that holds at least 1 NFT receives `X` tokens. Membership into the DAO will require these same `X` tokens. We also want to provide additional tokens through the airdrop to reward more active members.

Members that participated in our snapshot voting or claimed a meeting POAP **before Season 0** will receive `Y` additional tokens.

The equation for the member allocation section for each member will then be:

> X Tokens (Holding NFT) + Y Tokens (If Voted or POAP)

### Snapshot Voting & POAP Claiming

Due to timezones, not everyone was able to attend meetings and claim POAPs. However, our snapshot votes lasted for many days allowing the chance for everyone to vote.

There are **906 unique addresses** eligible for these additional tokens.

## 2 - Early Contributors (Coordinape)

Many DAO members have been early contributors to the DAO without the expectation of reward. The $CODE issuance will set a percentage of tokens aside for early contributors. We will launch a Coordinape circle to distribute these tokens. Core Team members & advisors will not be eligible for Early Contributor rewards.

Coordinape works by giving every DAO member 100 GIVE. Each member can send GIVE to other DAO members they believe have contributed to the DAO. Once completed, Coordinape will provide a map and totals for all members who have received GIVE. The DAO will then take the totals and make any adjustments necessary to ensure the distribution is fair and fulfills the ratified purpose of rewarding core early contributors.

The epoch for the Early Contributors circle ran for 10 days from March 7 to March 17th 2022. The circle ended with 305 total members receiving GIVE.

### Overview of Strategy for Final Distribution

The following strategy was then applied to the raw coordinape information to align the results with the ratified purpose of the Early Contributor rewards.

1. First, any GIVE send above 10 was capped to 10. For example - if Alice sent Bob 15 GIVE, Alice will only receive 10 GIVE. If Bob sent Alice 9 GIVE, Alice receives the entire 9 GIVE.
2. Second, core contributors are verified by contribution leaders in the DAO. You can read more about this process and see the verification results [on our wiki](https://developerdao.notion.site/85f6ebe5393a43d9aabd682c269bd8f9?v=90f747eca99e4a66afca60f5b7ff19d5).
3. Third, a GIVE cap is placed on **unverified contributors**. The GIVE cap was decided as 10 GIVE.
    1. This equates to 605 $CODE. This more than doubles a members initial $CODE claim if they just held the NFT at snapshot, but keeps the distribution below that of many verified contributors.
    2. Because the cap is performed at the GIVE level, the $CODE is redistributed to verified contributors (since $CODE is distributed as a percentage of GIVE held for the epoch).
4. Fourth and finally, a $CODE cap is placed on **verified contributors**. The $CODE cap was decided as 40,000 $CODE.
    1. This cap applies to a very small number of contributors: 3.
    2. This cap is applied to ensure the allocation fits within the broader tokenomics of Developer DAO.
    3. The extra code (~13,410 $CODE) will be reclaimed by the treasury.

### Vesting of Early Contributor Allocations

Any $CODE amount above 20,000 $CODE will be subject to vesting. The vesting applied will be the same vesting applied to the Core Team & Advisors allocations. Just as with the Core Team & Advisors, this is to slow the accumulation of $CODE into single hands. Only 8 members will have any $CODE vesting.

Vesting will be monthly releases for 24 months (2 years).
