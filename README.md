# Member Allocation & Early Contributors

_NOTE: This is an early suggestion for member & early contributor rewards ahead of the token issuance information. Join the conversation at #tokenomics in Discord._

Part of the goal in the Developer DAO token launch is to reward DAO members & early contributors with $CODE. There will be two separate `allocations` for members - two pieces of the pie.

1. A `member allocation` that will be claimed through the airdrop.
2. An `early contributors allocation` to members who have contributed to the DAO from the beginning of the DAO to the end of Season 0.

## 1 - Member Allocation (Airdrop)

The $CODE issuance will reward all DAO members with governance tokens. A DAO member is defined as a `Devs for Revolution` NFT holder before block #13612670. Each address that holds at least 1 NFT receives `X` tokens. Membership into the DAO will require these same `X` tokens. We also want to provide additional tokens through the airdrop to reward more active members.

Members that participated in our snapshot voting or claimed a meeting POAP **before Season 0** will receive `Y` additional tokens.

The equation for the member allocation section for each member will then be:

> X Tokens (Holding NFT) + Y Tokens (If Voted or POAP)

### Snapshot Voting & POAP Claiming

Due to timezones, not everyone was able to attend meetings and claim POAPs. However, our snapshot votes lasted for many days allowing the chance for everyone to vote.

There are **906 unique addresses** eligible for these additional tokens.

## 2 - Early Contributors (Coordinape)

Many DAO members have been early contributors to the DAO without the expectation of reward. The $CODE issuance will set a percentage of tokens aside for early contributors. We will launch a Coordinape circle to distribute these tokens. Core Team members will not be eligible for Early Contributor rewards.

Coordinape works by giving every DAO member 100 VOTEs. Each member can send VOTEs to other DAO members they believe have contributed to the DAO. Once completed, Coordinape will provide a map and totals for all members who have received VOTEs. The $CODE set aside for early contributors will be claimable by these eligible members based on the distribution of the VOTEs.
